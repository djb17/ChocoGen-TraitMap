# ChocoGen-TraitMap
The ChocoGen research project was launched with the objective of enabling genetic research on a primarily Afro-Colombian population. This initiative has two main goals: firstly, to analyze and identify the genetic ancestry of the Chocó population; and secondly, to investigate how ancestry relates to genetic factors that influence health and disease in the region.
